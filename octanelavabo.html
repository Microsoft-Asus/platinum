  <title> PGRU - Octane Lavabo </title>
</head>

<body class="bgoctane">
<p> Octane Lavabo is the holiest girl in the world. She has a PHD in choir pop music  from L'École des Ursulines de Québec. Sometimes, she collaborates with her sister Skate Bush. Skate Bush did not attend L'École des Ursulines de Québec. This is why she is not holy. Skate Bush practices skateboard and cry pop. However, Octane Lavabo is the only one that is signed to Platinum Gold Records because Skate Bush is not talented at anything except skateboard. </p>
