    <h1> DIE VIRGIN SCUM </h1>
    <p> A NOVEL BY BRYLIN ROMERO </p>
    <div id="chapterone"> <h2> CHAPTER ONE <h2> </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p> The sun shone modestly. Brohth was going to market to buy weed, when suddenly Drahglare and Xinoenah intercepted him. <br> <br> <br>

      	Brohth : “Get ur puxsies outa the wayyy!! I’m getting my sweet kush from the market!” <br><br>
      	Xinoenah: “I thought we were gonna fak in FuoklarBleu™ today!!!!!“ <br><br>
      	Drahglare: “Don’t u wanna do the SEX in FuoklarBleu™ today???” <br> <br> <br>

      Brohth was so angered. Brohth had just started 2 days of pure chaste walks with NO SEX faking in FuoklarBleu™ (his fave international Ultra Lounge but NOT a good place for VIRGINS) <br><br> <br>

      	Brohth: “I need to buy weed PLUS I’m a Virgin, you stoopid fatheads but stilll hot!!!! Why did you think I wanted to fak u??? I emailed u!!!! My email said ‘hi I’m good now’." <br> <br>

      	Xinoenah : "hi very good okay your email said come meet me on the roof top fuck pad we were waiting for hours!!" <br><br>

      	Daghlare : "Oh my gohd you must have been hacked! who would do that to you? that is so evil." <br><br>
      	Xinoenah : "maybe it was your dirty archgeninisis GAY Bringle."" <br> <br><br>

      Brohth pondered for a minute… thought of the days when Brohth and Bringle used to cross streams… hold each others pingpanks… drink beers… write rock n roll songs… or poetry….some may say….<br><br><br>
      He paused….<br>
      “Bringle wouldn’t betray me like that…”<br><br>
      Xinoeonah: “But u know Bringle always wanted to fak you.<br><br><br>

      Brohth smiled sheepishly and darted his opalescently deep blue eyes to the dusty upper corner of the opalescent epicentre that was the crumbling cookie in Dahglare’s agelessly translucently formless hand.<br><br>
      	“You know……………. Sometimes love is like a dollar store coupon you got from your Aunt Shrilp’s tupperware and forgot in the pocket of your diamond encrusted Levi coinpurse………. Next thing you know, you’re digging for something larger than the chicken village you grew up in so that you can buy a petite HoleInTheWall Creative Loft repurposed to share with a DJ and 6 men…. 6 men who don’t recognize the child within your raw pumping chest heart….. but then it comes loose (the child)….. pops as popcorn does out of your fluid body and runs away…….. You reach into your pocket…. fully realizing that coupon you found in your aunt’s Tupperware you needed after all.”<br> <br><br>

      Brohth’s story was interrupted when a sexified Prius drifted in, almost colliding with Brohth’s silky form.<br><br>
      “get in losers!” yelled Smaghma, Brohth’s cousin.<br>
      “dude you totally ruined my vibe. I was trying to tell these tittieholders about my ex-friend who was trying to fak’s me.<br><br>
      “What a bummer but C'MON” Smaghma winked.<br> <br>

      Xinohnah: “Why should we go anywhere with you ur not even a virgin like Brohth”<br><br>
      Smaghma: “I’m heading to Formless Wafer Cafe to see Bringle’s new acoustic folk fusion project, Mediterranean Blitz. It’s gonna be EPIK!”<br><br>
      Daghlare:  “That does sound epic BRO this could be your chance to see if Bringle is the hacker scum who is coming between you and ur immaculacy.”<br><br>
      Brohth: “You're right day Daghlare let's ride.”<br><br>
      Xinohnah: “Play something by SucPuxsy, Smaghma!”<br><br>

      They all sang along to Cushion Crap on their way to Formless Wafer Cafe. It went like this: <br> <br><br>

      cousin cousin spare me a dime<br>
      I’m not gonna get to the baptism in time<br>
      cousin cousin, make a wish<br>
      For the drought has killed my favourite fish<br> <br>

      That cushion is so comfy I must sit down<br>
      I fak on the cushions in town<br>
      I’m wishing for an armchair<br>
      To fak my puxsi til I’m bare<br>
      I will come on ur water cooler<br>
      Take ur wife to court and sue her<br> <br>

      Crapcrapcushion crap.<br>
      Slapslap my cushion ass.<br> <br>

      brethren brethren spare me a lime<br>
      i’m thirsty for cummies and aged wine<br>
      brethren brethren, blow a kiss.<br>
      for the slab has hybrids<br> <br>

      Crapcrapcushion crap.<br>
      Slapslap my cushion ass.<br> <br><br>

      After singing to their fave bop and running 7 red lights, the young whippersnappers finally reached their destination and boy oh boy they were hungry.<br><br>

      " this song is a good depiction of masculine fragility through the lens of music juxtaposed with the primary bond of family and w33d." articulated Smahgema.<br><br>

       everyone in the Prius was  so turned on by Smahgema's analysis so they all did it except for broth who is a virgin and dignifiedly proud.
