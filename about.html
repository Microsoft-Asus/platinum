<body>
  <p class="backtext"> In a world of post disciplinary disciplines only the conjunction of sound scape and audio space rejuxtaposed as cyber-media can redefine the axis on which disciplines ask and reinterpret the space. Platinum Gold Records Unlimited does exactly that. The brainchild of music industry insider Brylen Romero, PGRU was conceived in the womb of the beating heart of Miami in 2016. With an unparalleled team and a collective mindset based around a post-capitalist industrial comprehensive sphere, PGRU exames pop culture without precedent. With a visionary approach toward discovering, nurturing, and catering collaborative inter-post-disciplinary talent, Brylen Romero has made Platinum Gold Records Unlimited home to an impressive generation of major artistic movers.
