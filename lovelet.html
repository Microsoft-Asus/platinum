  <title> PGRU - Lovelet </title>
</head>

<body class="bglovelet">
<p> Originally from Edmonton, Lovelet began as the solo indie rock recording project of songwriter Tim Biziaev, and by 2016 formed into an emotive four-piece with members of Catgut, N3K, Morewine. During 2017 Tim Biziaev recorded with collaborator Layne L’Heureux at Discount Sound Studios and as of October 2018 released Lovelet’s debut full length “Couple’s Fight Night.” Released on Edmonton’s Double Lunch Productions, this downtempo pop statement features performances from numerous Edmonton musicians. As of August 2018 Tim Biziaev relocated to Montreal and, with a new group of musicians (members of Catbug, Andy and the Dannys, Crushhh), Lovelet is now based in Montreal. </p>
